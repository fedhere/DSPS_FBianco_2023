# READING: 

Read the Sessions 1 and 2 of [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf).


Remember to include a README.md, in markdown format, that states how your team worked: who you worked with and what you contributed specifically. Remember captions!!



# 1. Uncerainties and Dark Matter 

follow the instructions in the notebook [MWrotCurve_instructions.ipynb](MWrotCurve_instructions.ipynb)

# 2. 661 students (and extra credit for 461)

Problem on MCMC and estimation of uncertainties (TBD)

Problem 2 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf). Most of the stuff you need to do it is in the Pi lab we did in class (e.g. the "isin" function is the same scheme you will use to reject proposals)
