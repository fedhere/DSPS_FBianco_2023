# READING 
- section 1 and section 5 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.4686.pdf. Really you should treasure this article and read it over time in full and with attention and attempt the exercises! but for the assignments, you just need to read section 1 and 5 and the associated footnotes.

# Assignment:
the assignment is in 3 parts in the notebook in this folder. 
- redo the sklearn line fit with training-test split (already done, due on 10/19. If you did not do it then do it now and you will get 1/2 the available points = 1.5)
- Implement the MCMC parameter exploration (optimization) for a new model for the GRB afterglow, a broken power law. Note: the best way to do this is to take my notebook which is mostly filled in and fill in the cells that are missing with what we did togeter in class and what you did in the assignment 4.5. Compared to the version in class, I defined a plotting function `plotlogtime()` which should be helpful to you to plot the models. You can modify the plotting cells of code if you wish.
- Measure the relative performance of the MCMC optimized models with log_likelihood_ratio, AIC, BIC (follow the instructions. We will talk about interpretation in class)
