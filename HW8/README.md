Part 1: 
  - Find a bad plot and a good plot by looking through papers on https://arxiv.org/.
  - Download the image or screenshot it and post it to your HW8 README.md. 
The README.md should contain each of the two images, a description of why it is good/bad based on the criteria discussed in class for data and scientific visualizations https://slides.com/federicabianco/dsps_10

What is wrong with it: - ambiguity, distortion, distraction

Is it respecting the 5 Tufteâ€™s rules:

- **effect size ~ 1**: The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graph itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented   ("lie factor")                                                                                                                          
- **data/ink >> 1**: Clear, detailed and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity.  Write out explanations of the data on the graph itself.  Label important events in the data                                                                             
- **no chart junk**: Show data variation, not design variation                                                                                
- **use small-multiples if comparisons are to be made** In time-series displays of money, deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement are nearly always better than nominal units.                                                                                                                                
- **avoid redundancy in communication**: The number of information carrying (variable) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data. Graphics must not quote data out of context.


Part 2: take a plot from any of the homework or your research it to improve it. The new improved version should be made in python. 
Post the old version and the new version on the same README and discuss the changes you made, the reason for them, and how they improve the plot. 
Make sure the caption of the final plot is complete: include **WHAT** is being plotted and how to allow the reader to understand the plot and **WHY** its important: what is interesting, what is noticeable about the data/result.

GRADING: Your assignment HW8 will be peer-reviewed (reviewed by a classmate)
